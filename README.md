# LabelimgFixed
Hello everyone, for a long time I struggled with one error that occurs when zooming in Labelimg. There was also a mistake related to scrolling. I've put together the fixes so you don't have to search 20 sites.

My fix removes errors on the lines:

line 1014, in zoom_request line 974, in add_zoom line 971, in set_zoom etc
